# AIPredictionModel-TestScore
Can a computer predict a test score using study and sleep time? This project uses a simple AI model to predict a student’s test score based on hours studied and hours slept.
I am trying to see if a computer can predict a test score using study time and sleep.
The project trains a simple AI model using sample data and makes test score predictions.
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Google Sheets, GitHub
The model successfully predicts realistic test scores.
I learned how data is used to train an AI model.
